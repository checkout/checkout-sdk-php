## Installation

### Installation with Composer (Recommended)

```bash
composer require checkout/checkout-sdk-php
```

Or require the Checkout.com package inside the composer.json file of your project:
```php
"require": { "php": ">=5.6", "checkout/checkout-sdk-php": "1.0.0"}.
```

### Clone repository
Alternatively you can clone the repository from GitHub with git clone
```bash
git clone git@github.com:checkout/checkout-sdk-php.git
```

## Quickstart

A card token can be obtained using one of Checkout.com's JavaScript frontend solutions such as [Frames](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/frames "Frames") or any of the [mobile SDKs](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/sdks#section-mobile-sdk-libraries "Mobile SDKs")

Include a `checkout-sdk-php/checkout.php` to access the operations for each API:

```php
use Checkout\CheckoutApi;
use Checkout\Models\Tokens\Card;
use Checkout\Models\Payments\TokenSource;
use Checkout\Models\Payments\Payment;

// Set the secret key
$secretKey = 'sk_test_key';

// Initialize the Checkout API in Sandbox mode. Use new CheckoutApi($liveSecretKey, false); for production
$checkout = new CheckoutApi($secretKey);


// Create a payment method instance with card details
$method = new TokenSource('tok_key_goes_here');

// Prepare the payment parameters
$payment = new Payment($method, 'GBP');
$payment->amount = 1000; // = 10.00

// Send the request and retrieve the response
$response = $checkout->payments()->request($payment);
```
